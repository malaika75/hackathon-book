# Module 1: ROS 2 Fundamentals

Welcome to the first module of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook. This module provides a comprehensive introduction to Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2), which forms the foundation for all subsequent modules.

## Overview

In this module, you will learn:
- Core concepts of ROS 2 architecture
- How to work with nodes, topics, services, and actions
- Essential command-line tools for ROS 2 development
- How to create and manage packages and workspaces
- Client library usage in both Python and C++
- Working with data types and coordinate transformations
- System orchestration with launch files

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- Navigate the ROS 2 ecosystem and use essential tools
- Develop basic ROS 2 nodes for communication and data handling
- Understand the core concepts of ROS 2 for robotic control
- Apply proper project structure and build practices
- Implement communication patterns for robotic applications

## Labs

This module includes two hands-on labs:
- **Lab 1**: Basic communication with publisher/subscriber pattern
- **Lab 2**: Advanced communication with services and actions

Each lab includes step-by-step instructions and solution guides to reinforce the concepts learned in this module.
