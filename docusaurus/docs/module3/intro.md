# Module 3: AI-Robot Brain: Perception, Navigation, and Manipulation

Welcome to Module 3 of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook. This module focuses on the artificial intelligence aspects of robotics, covering perception systems, navigation, and manipulation - the core capabilities that enable robots to understand and interact with their environment.

## Overview

In this module, you will learn:
- Robot perception systems using computer vision
- Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM)
- ROS 2 Navigation Stack configuration
- Path planning algorithms
- Robot manipulation techniques
- State estimation using filters
- Integration of perception, navigation, and manipulation

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- Apply AI techniques for robot perception and understanding the environment
- Develop autonomous navigation strategies using ROS 2 Navigation Stack
- Implement basic robot manipulation tasks
- Understand and implement state estimation techniques
- Configure and tune navigation systems
- Plan paths for mobile robots in complex environments

## Labs

This module includes two hands-on labs:
- **Lab 5**: SLAM and Navigation in an unknown environment
- **Lab 6**: Object detection and grasping with a manipulator

Each lab provides practical experience with AI-robot integration, allowing you to apply perception, navigation, and manipulation techniques to solve real-world robotic challenges.
