# Introduction

Welcome to the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook. This comprehensive guide covers the fundamentals of modern robotics, from ROS 2 basics to advanced Visual Language-Action models for humanoid robots.

## Course Overview

This textbook is structured into four progressive modules:

- **Module 1**: Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2) Fundamentals
- **Module 2**: Robotics Simulation and Environment Interaction
- **Module 3**: AI-Robot Brain: Perception, Navigation, and Manipulation
- **Module 4**: Visual Language-Action (VLA) Models for Humanoid Robotics

Each module builds upon the previous one, taking you from basic robotic control systems to cutting-edge AI integration in humanoid robotics applications.
