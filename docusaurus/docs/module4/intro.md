# Module 4: Visual Language-Action (VLA) Models for Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to Module 4 of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook. This module explores the cutting-edge intersection of large language models, computer vision, and robotic action - known as Visual Language-Action (VLA) models. These systems enable humanoid robots to understand natural language commands and execute complex tasks in real-world environments.

## Overview

In this module, you will learn:
- How large language models (LLMs) and multimodal AI work in robotics contexts
- The principles of vision-language models (VLMs) and their applications in robotics
- How to bridge language understanding with physical robot actions
- Natural language processing techniques for robot command interpretation
- Methods for grounding language in visual and physical world states
- Case studies of VLA applications in humanoid robotics
- Ethical considerations in deploying AI-powered humanoid robots

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- Understand the principles of Visual Language-Action models
- Explore how VLAs enable human-robot interaction through natural language
- Apply VLAs to control humanoid robots for complex tasks
- Design systems that interpret natural language commands as robot actions
- Consider ethical implications and safety measures in humanoid AI systems
