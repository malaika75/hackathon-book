# Module 2: Robotics Simulation and Environment Interaction

Welcome to Module 2 of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook. This module focuses on robotics simulation environments, which are essential for developing, testing, and validating robotic systems without requiring physical hardware.

## Overview

In this module, you will learn:
- How to work with robotic simulation environments like Gazebo/Ignition and Webots
- Robot description formats (URDF and SDF)
- Integration of ROS 2 with simulation platforms
- Physics engines and realistic simulation principles
- Sensor simulation and data generation
- Environment modeling and world creation
- Kinematics in simulation environments

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- Utilize robotic simulation environments for development and testing
- Integrate ROS 2 with simulation platforms
- Understand physics engines and their role in realistic simulations
- Create and configure robot models for simulation
- Simulate various sensors and interpret their data
- Implement kinematic solutions in simulation environments

## Labs

This module includes two hands-on labs:
- **Lab 3**: Creating and spawning robot models in simulation
- **Lab 4**: Sensor integration and data acquisition in simulation

Each lab provides practical experience with the concepts learned in this module, allowing you to apply simulation techniques to real-world robotic problems.
