# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook Constitution

## Core Principles

### Accuracy
Through verified references on robotics, ROS2, Gazebo, Isaac Sim, and AI integration.

### Clarity
For a university-level audience with computer science and robotics background.

### Reproducibility
All code snippets, simulations, and examples must be traceable and testable.

### Rigor
Prioritize peer-reviewed sources, official documentation, and standard robotics references.

### Key Standards

- Code examples must run and reproduce expected behavior

### Constraints
- Word count per chapter: 3,000–5,000 words
- Minimum sources per chapter: 10
- Include diagrams, simulation screenshots, and relevant code
- Format: Markdown for Docusaurus integration
